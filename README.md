# 🐻 SNIPPETS-MISIE 🐻

- Place your snippets for any language you want according filename in `snippets` folder.
- Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and description. 
- The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted.
- Possible variables are: $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders.
- Placeholders with the same ids are connected.

### 👉 Example:

```json
"Print to console": {
	"prefix": "log",
	"body": [
		"console.log('$1');",
		"$2"
	],
	"description": "Log output to console"
}
```
